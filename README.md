I want to present a web api for working with habits, for which I created a separate identity server and React application. I used a clean architecture, tried to write good code for easier future support, feature enhancements and simple changes.  

Full technology stack: 
- ASP.NET Core, REST
- SQLite, Entity Framework
- OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, Identity Server
- Swagger, Fluent Validation, XUnit, Automapper, Serilog
- NSwag Studio, React, TS 
- Used the MediatR library in combination with CQRS to implement a scalable system that can be easily and quickly modified

Run the React app (using VS Code), the identity server, and the web API itself.
