I want to present a web api that I developed following the tutorial. I created a separate identity server for it and generated a React application. I used a clean architecture, tried to write good code for easier future support, feature enhancements and simple changes.  

Full technology stack: 
- ASP.NET Core, REST
- SQLite, Entity Framework, Identity Server
- Swagger, Fluent Validation, XUnit, Automapper 
- NSwag Studio, React 
- Used the MediatR library in combination with CQRS to implement a scalable system that can be easily and quickly modified

Run the React app (using VS Code), the identity server, and the web API itself.
